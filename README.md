# drop_blacklisted
This mod adds the /drop [param...] command, which sets a blacklist for unwanted drops. Very useful for mining if used to blacklist cobble and silver sand as shown:

/drop default:cobble default:silver_sand

Each player has it's own blacklist. For now, every blacklist is reset when the game resets.
